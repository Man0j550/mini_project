    <h1 style="color: red;">Right to Make Choose :</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">
        The "Right to Make Choice Act" is not a specific legislation or provision in the Indian Constitution. However, the right to make choices as consumers is implicitly protected through various laws and regulations in India. Consumer rights in India are safeguarded by a combination of legislation, government agencies, and consumer protection measures that ensure consumers have the freedom to make informed choices. Below are key aspects that pertain to the right to make choices as consumers in India. <br></p>
        <h2 style="color: red;">Key Features of the Right to Make Choice Act :</h2>
        <h2 style="color: white;">1. Consumer Protection Act, 2019 :</h2><p style="color: white;"> This act is a fundamental piece of legislation that explicitly ensures the right of consumers to make choices. It prohibits unfair trade practices and misleading advertisements, enabling consumers to make informed decisions. It also allows consumers to seek redressal in case of defective products or deficient services, further protecting their choices.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">2. Competition Law :</h2><p style="color: white;"> The Competition Act, 2002, aims to promote competition and prevent anti-competitive practices in the market. It ensures that consumers have a choice by preventing monopolistic and unfair trade practices. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is responsible for enforcing this law.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">3. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) :</h2> <p style="color: white;">BIS sets quality standards for various products to ensure that consumers can make informed choices about the quality and safety of products. Products conforming to BIS standards are typically marked with the ISI mark, signifying their adherence to quality guidelines.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">4. Consumer Organizationss :</h2><p style="color: white;">Consumer associations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) work to protect consumer rights, advocate for informed choices, and provide support to consumers who face issues with products or services.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">5. Advertising Standards :</h2> <p style="color: white;">The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) regulates advertising to prevent false or misleading claims. This ensures that consumers have access to accurate information when making choices based on advertisements.
