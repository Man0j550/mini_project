    <h1 style="color: red;">Right to Safety:</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">
        In India, the "Right to Safety" is one of the fundamental rights provided to consumers under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. This right emphasizes the need for consumer protection by ensuring that the products and services they purchase do not pose a threat to their health or safety. The Right to Safety, as defined by the Indian Consumer Protection Act, ensures that consumers have the right to be protected from hazardous, unsafe, or potentially harmful products and services. It places the responsibility on manufacturers and service providers to produce and deliver safe and quality products and services to consumers.<br></p>
        <h2 style="color: red;">Key Features of the Right to Safety:</h2>
        <h2 style="color: white;">1. Product Safety : </h2><p style="color: white;">Manufacturers are legally obliged to produce goods that meet safety standards and do not pose a risk to consumers when used as intended. If a product is found to be unsafe, it is the manufacturer's responsibility to take corrective actions, such as product recalls or improvements.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">2. Service Safety :</h2><p style="color: white;"> Service providers are required to offer services that do not endanger consumers' well-being. This means ensuring that services are delivered in a safe and competent manner, adhering to established safety protocols.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">3. Consumer Information :</h2> <p style="color: white;">Manufacturers and service providers are expected to provide consumers with clear and accurate information about the potential risks associated with their products or services. This includes labeling, instructions for use, and any warnings.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">4. Recall and Remedies :</h2><p style="color: white;">In cases where a product or service poses a safety risk, the law allows for product recalls, repairs, replacements, or refunds to protect consumers from harm.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">5. Liability for Injuries :</h2> <p style="color: white;">If a consumer is injured or experiences harm due to an unsafe product or service, they have the right to seek compensation or legal action against the responsible party. This holds manufacturers and service providers accountable for their products' safety.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">6. Consumer Awareness :</h2><p style="color: white;">The Right to Safety also emphasizes the importance of consumer education and awareness. It encourages consumers to be vigilant about the safety of the products they purchase and to report unsafe products or services to the appropriate authorities.</p>
