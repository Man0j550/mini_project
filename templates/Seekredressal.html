    <h1 style="color: red;">Right to Seek Redressal :</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">
        There is no specific "Right to Seek Redressal Act" in the Indian Constitution. However, consumers' right to seek redressal is an essential aspect of consumer protection in India, and it is upheld through various consumer protection laws and regulations. Here's an overview of how the right to seek redressal is protected for consumers in India: <br></p>
        <h2 style="color: red;">Key Features of the Right to Seek Redressal Act :</h2>
        <h2 style="color: white;">1. Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissions :</h2><p style="color: white;"> Under the Consumer Protection Act, consumers can approach various consumer dispute redressal commissions, including the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, depending on the value of the claim. These commissions have the authority to hear consumer complaints, issue orders, and provide compensation to aggrieved consumers.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">2. Product Liability Claims :</h2><p style="color: white;">  The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, also includes provisions for product liability, allowing consumers to file claims against manufacturers, sellers, and service providers for injuries or damage caused by defective products or services.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">3. Online Consumer Complaint Portals :</h2> <p style="color: white;">Some states and organizations provide online consumer complaint portals that make it easier for consumers to file and track their complaints. These portals facilitate the redressal process.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">4. Consumer Associations and NGOs :</h2><p style="color: white;">Consumer organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in representing consumers and helping them seek redressal. These organizations often provide guidance and support to consumers during the complaint filing process.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">5. Ombudsman Schemes :</h2> <p style="color: white;">In certain sectors, such as banking and insurance, ombudsman schemes have been established to address consumer grievances. These schemes provide an informal and cost-effective means of seeking redressal.
